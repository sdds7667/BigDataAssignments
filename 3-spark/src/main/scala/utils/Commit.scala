 * Note that these classes are sealed, much like final in Java. This means that you cannot create extensions of these
 * classes outside of the file where they are defined. You can create extensions of these classes, but the grader will
 * not take the code you put in this file into account, as it only assesses the code in the `src.main.scala.*` folders.
