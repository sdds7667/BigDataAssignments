This part of the assignment gives a brief introduction into the Scala language. 
All 4 parts together give you 15 points.

- [x] (3p) Learn how to implement functions [here](<Functions.scala>). 
- [x] (3p) Learn how lists work and how to operate on them [here](<Lists.scala>).
- [x] (4p) Learn about pattern matching [here](<PatternMatching.scala>).
- [x] (5p) Practice your newly gained knowledge [here](<Practice.scala>).

Implement all functions yourself, i.e. do not use library functions (except Q2).
