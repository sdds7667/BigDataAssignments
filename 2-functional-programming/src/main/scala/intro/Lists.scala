   * @param xs the list of items.
   * @param x  only use numbers strictly larger than x.
   * @param n  how many items to consider for the average.

   *         Hint:
   *         Read the Scaladoc on the List class (https://www.scala-lang.org/api/2.12.3/scala/collection/immutable/List.html)
   *         It contains some useful functions for this exercise. For this question library functions are allowed.
