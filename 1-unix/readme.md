    # Assignment Unix

This is the Unix assignment of Big Data Processing, CSE2520

## Setup of the assignment

This assignment consists of 3 parts:

1. [An introduction to Unix and the terminal](<intro/readme.md>)
    
    In this part, you will start by setting up your environment.
    When your environment is set up, it begins with the basics of navigating the terminal and writing bash scripts.
     
2. [Pipelines](<pipelines/readme.md>)

    A pipeline is a sequence of one or more commands.
    In this part, you will use pipelines to experience the power of combining commands and the efficiency of data manipulation.

3. [Script creation](<script_creation/readme.md>)

    Now that you know how to use pipelines, it is time to create a few scripts that can automate tasks.
    
You are strongly advised to complete the parts in this order.

## Grading
### Automatic grading
You can hand in your solutions on [CPM](https://cpm.ewi.tudelft.nl) and see the results of the automatic grading.
This only gives you an overall grade, no details of the failures.

Your submission should be a zip file containing all the `.sh` files used in the assignments.
Do not change the names of the `.sh` files as this will result in the grading script no longer recognizing them.
Missing `.sh` files will be considered as incorrect answers.
